First we need to substract the value of each index of arr2 with 24 which is the smallest value of arr2.
After the first step, we got the new value of arr2 ranging from 0 - 17.
Then in order to create a sentence that make sense we must reverse arr1 and create a new array using reverse arr1 letters and using arr2 values as index.
